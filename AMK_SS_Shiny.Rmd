A food court is a collection of food vendors, typically found in
shopping malls, airports, and other high-traffic locations. These
vendors offer a variety of food options, including fast food, ethnic
cuisine, and specialty items such as desserts and beverages. Food courts
are designed to provide customers with a convenient and efficient way to
grab a quick meal or snack while on the go. They often feature a seating
area for customers to enjoy their food and may also have amenities such
as free Wi-Fi and charging stations.

The question now lies in, what configuration is more efficient?

---

## Choping

To chope is to book a table or queue for a table to be available. This
behaviour is typically borne of a forward thinking consumer who wishes
to secure the future of their dining experience. Additionally, this
behaviour is typically expectandly borne out of prior experience in
having had to wait laborious hours for tables in one's lifetime.

---

## Not choping

The bolder approach to one's dining experience. This is characterized by
one queueing for food directly, prioritizing acquisition over
reconciliation.

---

## Efficiency {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

Efficiency in a food court setting, can be interpreted in a number of
ways. We decided to categorise them based off of.

## Assumptions

::: row
::: col-md-4
### Stall eating times

<br><br>Stall eating times have been stated to be of a Normal
distribution, with given means and standard deviations respectively.

**The Gaussian distribution does not strictly adhere to a positive range
of values and is prone to generating negative numbers. As such, when
negative numbers were generated in the simulation, the function was
rerun until a positive number was derived.**
:::

::: col-md-4
### Customer influx

<br><br>A plot was provided showing a distribution of customer group
sizes over the week.

**Instead of using the static, provided values to randomly take from, a
rate to generate customers from a Poisson distribution was determined**.
:::

::: col-md-4
### Queue space

<br><br>According to the data collector, only 12 people are able to fit
comfortably into the standing space in the shop - **after having allowed
for space for queues**.

**We assume that queues allow for infinite space for customers since
this is not elaborated on**.
:::
:::

::: row
::: col-md-4
### Customer Group atomicity

<br><br>Customer groups do not break up.

**Hence, customer groups in the waiting list will wait until the table
accomodates for their group size, and only begin the eating timer when
this condition has been fulfilled.**
:::

::: col-md-4
### Crowding deterrance rules

<br><br>When crowded, newcomers in groups tend to leave without
waiting - if they are not choping.

Any waiting person with food, waits indefinitely for food.

**At full capacity, no new customers in group sizes above 2 will enter
the coffeeshop if they are not choping. If they are choping, they will
wait 10minutes**.

**Chopers will NOT cut people who have been waiting earlier for tables -
even if the earlier group's size precludes them from occupying the
available tables and the newcomers' doesn't**.
:::

::: col-md-4
### Takeaway

<br><br><br>30% of takeaways ordered multiple portions of food.

**We strictly apply a multinomial distribution where there is a 20%
chance of the patron to purchase 2 portions, 10% for 4, and 70% for 1.
This only applies for takeaway patrons**.

All other patrons are assumed to only ever purchase 1 portion (per
customer, not Customer group). This consideration is of course, not
overriding the fact that some patrons may be ordering on behalf of other
customers in their Customer group.
:::

Hints to the potentially crucial recordable metrics in this operation
were hinted by the illustrated scenario. These metrics included but were
not limited to:

<!-- * Metrics -->

<!--       + Cooking Time -->

<!--           -Normally distributed -->

<!--           -Parameters depend on each stall -->

<!--       + Eating Time -->

<!--           -Normall distributed -->

## Key Variables {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

Variables are required to depict each of the primary agents in this
simulation.

### Customer

Represents each customer GROUP (Customer) in the foodcourt. We can call
this conceptualization, a "struct".

Customers that have committed to eating at the foodcourt are designated
a space in a Customer Vector, which is regularly updated in the time
loop.

::: row
::: col-md-4
#### Group Size

<br><br>

Number of customers, making up the group.

In the simulation, this is not entirely accurate. We do set values 1-8
to represent the number of customers directly, but we also incorporate
the number '0' to indicate customers that are only there for takeaway.
:::

::: col-md-4
#### Chope

<br><br><br>A boolean that denotes the customer's behaviour: to chope or not
to chope.
:::

::: col-md-4
#### Queued

<br><br>

A boolean that denotes if the customer has COMPLETED queueing. It is
important that this boolean does not update from its default FALSE state
UNTIL the customer has already finished queueing
:::
:::

::: row
::: col-md-4
#### Eaten

<br><br><br>

Similar boolean, to denote if customer has eaten or not.
:::

::: col-md-4
#### Current \| Time {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}


##### Info

This is a u32 variable that is regularly deducted in each iteration
(whereby each iteration represents time). If this reaches 0, and other
special circumstances are not a priority, the Customer's status is
typically updated to the succeeding activity.

##### Example

For example, having queued = FALSE to queued = TRUE, followed by calling
a function for the Customer to allocate their eating time (that is
rolled for at the inception of the Customer object being created) to the
Current variable and to be counted down from. This situation would only
be for a 'chope' Customer, since a Customer who was not choping would
have to now wait for a table first. More importantly, this would also
only apply for Customer that ARE NOT of group-size 0, in other words,
takeaway customers.

##### Additional note

Note that the non-choping customer's "waiting for table" time, is NOT
constant with time itself, whereas the eating time of every Customer is
independent of time. You COULD conceivably call for a customer to
specifically roll for their eating time WHEN they are at a table,
however, in this simulation, we assume that eating time is not affected
by other Customers (only customers within the group since we have to
take the maximum eating time of the group).
:::

::: col-md-4
#### Choice of Stall

<br><br><br>

Stalls chosen by each customer. This is an array of values stored and
generated from to calculate, the Eating time, as well as tabulate the
queueing time later on when relevant to the customer.
:::

::: col-md-4
#### Time spent

<br><br><br>

This is the total time the Customer has spent in the court, and is
purely there for metric purposes.
:::
:::

### Tables

#### Table array

A fixed array of 48 spaces. Initialized with values of 0, to represent
unoccupied seats and they are updated with the occupying Customer's
eating time. Interested Customers do not occupy the table unless 2
conditions are fulfilled.

Firstly, the Waiting List for the Tables have to be empty.

Secondly, the tables have to have enough space for ALL the customers in
the group to occupy.

Simple array in construction.

#### Waiting list

This is the other "struct" (complicated variable) aside from Customer.
There are a number of defining features that explain this.

In fact, it is not even a struct, but a Vector of structs! The length of
the waiting list is never constant and changes based off of the
situation.

::: row
::: col-md-6
##### Group Size

This is the group-size of the Customer that is waiting in line. Copied
from the Customer occupying it.
:::

::: col-md-6
##### Eating Time

Eating time for the Customer in this slot
:::

::: col-md-6
##### Waiting Time

The waiting time for a Customer in this slot is either calculated by
comparing the Table array and calculating the wait time for enough
spaces to be available, OR from the "Future Table" configuration of the
predecessing Customer in the Waiting List.

The former happens if the Customer is the first and only one in the
Waiting List, and the latter occurs in all other scenarios.
:::

::: col-md-6
##### Future Table

The configuration of the Table array when the Customer group moves in to
finally occupy space in the Table array and eat.
:::
:::

### Queue times

Array of 5, recording the queue times of the 5 stalls.

## Conditions {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

Simulation created depicting this scenario runs on a set of conditions.
Some are inferred or modified versions of the ones demonstrated in the
scenario.

### Eating Time

Choice of stall is determined by a fixed "market share" concept. In
other words, the choice of stall is akin to a multinomial distribution.

```{r Stalls, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
inputPanel(
  
  sliderInput("bins", "Bin width", 1, min = 0.05, max = 20),
  
  sliderInput("N", "Simulation Size:", 700, min = 500, max = 30000)
  
)

renderPlot({
  N<-input$N
  df<-data.frame(
    stall = factor(rep(c("Stall 1", "Stall 2", "Stall 3","Stall 4","Stall 5"),each=N),
             ),
    Time = round(c(rnorm(N,18,2),rnorm(N,20,2.5),rnorm(N,16,2),rnorm(N,23,3),rnorm(N,17,1.5)))
  )
  ggplot(df, aes(x=Time, col=stall, fill=stall)) +
    geom_histogram( binwidth = input$bins,alpha=1.0, position="identity")
})
```

```{r Alternative_visualisation, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
inputPanel(

  sliderInput("no", "Number of Orders:", 700, min = 500, max = 30000)
  
)


renderUI({
  NO<-input$no
  print(typeof(NO))
  df<-data.frame(
    stall = factor(rep(c("Stall 1", "Stall 2", "Stall 3","Stall 4","Stall 5"),each=NO),
    ),
    Time = round(c(rnorm(NO,18,2),rnorm(NO,20,2.5),rnorm(NO,16,2),rnorm(NO,23,3),rnorm(NO,17,1.5)))
  )  
  
  df %>%
    group_by(stall) %>%
    summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    select(c(stall,Time)) %>%
    reactable(
      defaultColDef = colDef(
        align = 'center',
        cell = bubble_grid(
          data = .,
          number_fmt = scales::comma
        )
      )
    )

})
  
```

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Customer Influx

#### Customer Influx as a Poisson Process

A data collector's account for the influx of customers from respective
customer group size allocations presented composition data for a week
between 12pm to 2pm. Corresponding group sizes were 1 - 8, and aside
from those that wanted to dine in, there were also individuals that
simply came into the shop for takeout/takeaway.

The composition of the customer base was noted. Similarly, the total
number of customers that entered for the week per day, was noted.
However, in the case of the simulation, a fixed number of customers was
not set at the beginning to enter the shop and so forth. Instead, what
was done was an emulation of 2 homogeneous Poisson process - one for
each section of the peak hour (2/3 of the customers entering between the
60min period between 1215 and 1315, and the remaining 1/3 in the final
45min until 1400).

```{r Influx, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
inputPanel(
  
  sliderInput("Poissonbins", "Bin width", 0.45, min = 0.05, max = 1),
  
  sliderInput("rate", "Rate:", 2.8, min = 2.3, max = 3.0,step = 0.005)
  
)

renderPlot({
  N<-input$rate
  df<-data.frame(
    PeriodPacket = factor(rep(c("Period 1","Period 2"),times=c(60,45)),
    ),
    Customers = round(c(rpois(60,N),rpois(45,N*2/3)))
  )
  ggplot(df, aes(x=Customers, col=PeriodPacket, fill = PeriodPacket)) +
    geom_histogram( binwidth = input$Poissonbins,alpha=1.0, position="identity")
})
renderText({
  "Total number of customers generated is"
})
renderText({
  sum(rpois(60,input$rate)) + sum(rpois(45,input$rate*2/3))
})
```

So consider the hard data...

On Monday, 248 customers came in. On Tuesday, that was 206, and so on
and so forth. The Poisson process, with the appropriate rate, can be
used to approximately simulate a process whereby customers enter the
foodcourt such that the total number of customers who visited the shop,
is similar to that which was observed.

As stated in the data collection report, it was not entirely clear if
all customers who wanted to come in, truly were able to come in, and
purchase their desired products. There was an understanding that
generally all customers that had entered the food court, were able to
eventually get their food. In other words, there is no clear metric for
the customers who were discouraged from entering the food court due to
issues such as crowding.

To simplify the process, a rate of 2.8 was estimated to be roughly
appropriate for this simulation. However, in the code, we are simulating
Customer GROUPS, as a Poisson process, NOT individual customers. So
while this rate is not technically wrong, in the code, we are required
to determine a Poisson rate for a Poisson AND a multinomial case,
whereby there are 9 possible categories - [takeaway,1,2...,8].

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Customer Group Influx

#### Customer Influx as a Poisson Process + Multinomial attributes

The prior consideration is not an accurate representation of how the
code works.

Every iterative loop in this prospective simulation, represents a minute
in time. Within each minute, there is a chance of a Customer seed, being
spawned, for which we are relying on a Poisson parameter for the
appropriate rate. However, each Customer seed represents a group of
customers. This group could represent 1,2,to 8 people in a group. The
probabilities for the group size being that of which follows a
multinomial distribution - by design.

The following below is a reconfiguration of we need to determine as an
input for the simulation. Let us consider the following adjustment.

#### Multinomial consideration {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

Below are simple Poisson generator configurations based off of an
abridged version of the multinomial distribution of customer groups that
came in according to the data collector's report on Monday. All values
of 0 were changed to 1.

This multinomial distribution is set as - (28,26,46,18,5,1,1,1,2).

Take note that this simulation above DOES account for the fact that
there is a second period that has 2/3 the Poisson rate for 45minutes
(thus yielding 1/2 of the outputted customers on average, all other
factors considered equal).

##### Sampling some rates

Taking the Monday's multinomial distribution as an example, we can pass
it to R's rmultinom function to roll for each of these group sizes for
every Customer seed/group that is generated.

```{r adjustment}
real<- function(cust_group_no){
  if (cust_group_no==0){
    return(0)
  }
  summie <- 0
  for (i in 1:cust_group_no){
    cv<-rmultinom(1,1,c(28,26,46,18,5,1,1,1,2))
    cvlist<-to_vec(for(i in 3:9) cv[i]*(i-1))
    summie<-summie+sum(cv[1:2],cvlist)
  }
  return(summie)
}

```

We then generate Customer seeds at Poisson rates again like before, but
the total number of customers to calculate is now done with an
additional Multinomial calculation. This calculation is done for every
Customer seed - which in turn follows that Poisson process.

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  
  sliderInput("Poissonbins_", "Bin width", 1, min = 0.05, max = 1),
  
  sliderInput("rate_", "Rate:", 0.5, min = 0.1, max = 3.0,step = 0.005)
  
)

renderPlot({
  N<-input$rate_
  df<-data.frame(
    PeriodPacket = factor(rep(c("Period 1","Period 2"),times=c(60,45)),
    ),
    Customers = round(c(rpois(60,N),rpois(45,N*2/3)))
  )
  df$cust<-as.numeric(lapply(df$Customers,real))
  ggplot(df, aes(x=cust, col=PeriodPacket, fill = PeriodPacket)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = input$Poissonbins_,alpha=1.0, position="identity")
})
renderText({
  "Total number of customers generated is"
})
renderText({
  N<-input$rate_
  df_t<-data.frame(
    PeriodPacket = factor(rep(c("Period 1","Period 2"),times=c(60,45)),
    ),
    Customers = round(c(rpois(60,N),rpois(45,N*2/3)))
  )
  df_t$cust<-as.numeric(lapply(df_t$Customers,real))  
  sum(df_t$cust)
})
```

As we can see, the appropriate rate changes drastically!

##### $\lambda$ $\approx$ 1.1

  sliderInput("Poissonbins__", "Bin width", 0.5, min = 0.05, max = 1),

```

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Space

After allowing for queues in the shop, only 12 people are able to fit
comfortably in the shop. This is presumed to indicate 2 things.

Firstly, there is an infinite possible length for queues if the
situation called for it. This is an unrealistic assumption, yet given
the circumstances is a consideration we are going to go forward with in
our simulation.

Secondly, that there can be more than 12 people waiting inside the shop
for tables, but this puts the shop in a state of overcrowding, which
immediately disqualifies the shop from serving any new potential
incoming customers who are not adopting the chope methodology, UNLESS
these patrons are alone (take-away or dine in as 1).

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Seriality \| Order of Operations

There are 2 types of Customers that we are generating, and their order
of operations are different.

A choper, hunts for a table first, queues up, eats and then leaves.

A non-choper, queues, waits for a table indefinitely, eats and leaves.

These processes are assuming that they have already invested interested
in entering the food court and decided to purchase from the foodcourt.

This sequence of events is governed by 2 things: **time** and **status -
what have they done so far**.

## Results {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

Simulations of these scenarios were repeated a number of times
consecutively, and the indicative results were plotted as distributions.

Time distribution is referring to the total time spent by each customer
in the court.

Sales refers to the total number of orders fulfilled by the end of each
simulation.

Patrons refers to the total number of customers that invested their time
into the foodcourt and entered with the purpose of dining in or
purhchasing food from there.

Remaining Customers refers to the number of customers that remained in
the food court by the end of the peak hour.

Waiting for table refers to the number of customers in the food court
who were waiting for a table by the end of the peak hour.

## Remarks

By every measurable metric, it is apparent, that choping is efficient
from a business and social standpoint!

The difference between the 2 methods, hinges on the customers that are visiting the foodcourt alone.  This is because for non-chopers, the solo individuals are not deterred by any sort of overcrowding, whereas that is not the case for choping individuals who have come to the foodcourt alone.  

Combined with the fact that there is no length at which queues apparently deter customers from the foodcourt either, these, potentially unrealistic assumptions lead to the divergence between the 2 customer behaviours in this simulation.
